# Challenge 1

The main objective of this challenge is to develop an expert system capable of assisting
with the consumption management in an Energy Community. This community would
consist of a geographical area that would prioritize buying and selling energy inside
itself rather than having to trade with an external market, and where the producers of
energy existing there would do it in a renewable way. This way, a cleaner way of pro-
ducing energy would be promoted, as well as the existence of an energy market that’s
more focused on end-users, on a larger number of small producers and bi-directional
exchanges of energy, rather than the current centralized market consisting of few large
energy producers where the flow of energy is in a singular direction.

To respond to this, our system must be able to fulfill certain objectives:

• Lower energy consumption in an energy community

• Reduce energy spending in the community

• Promote the usage of renewable energy sources

• Avoid energy wasting by sending it to the grid

• Guarantee that the community-wide batteries are charged to be used in case of
energy scarcity or high energy prices
